# phase1-project;
my project for phase-1
first pick and API mine is from API ninjas
here is my API https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/cars?limit=30&model=supra,
my project took a closer look at my favorite car which is the supra
the title of the website is SUPRA WORLD
then the api is passed through postman and the code generated from postman is used in the javascript
before anything we first load the content to the DOM
AFTER THIS RENDER THE CONTENT TO THE WEB PAGE SO THAT WE CAN START manipulating it
since our api has a list we diplay our content to the web page in a list;
we create a html list in javascript
for each element of the API we add a like and a dislike button
add an event listiner for each of the buttons both the like and the dislike button
set the count for each button to be zero
