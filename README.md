# phase1-project;
my project for phase-1
first pick and API mine is from API ninjas
here is my API https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/cars?limit=30&model=supra,
my project took a closer look at my favorite car which is the supra
the title of the website is SUPRA WORLD
then the api is passed through postman and the code generated from postman is used in the javascript
before anything we first load the content to the DOM
AFTER THIS RENDER THE CONTENT TO THE WEB PAGE SO THAT WE CAN START manipulating it
since our api has a list we diplay our content to the web page in a list;
we create a html list in javascript
for each element of the API we add a like and a dislike button
add an event listiner for each of the buttons both the like and the dislike button
set the count for each button to be zero
appending the list to the container
creating a comment section to take the comments of the user
use an eventlistiner to add to the dom
give it the condition not to submit if the comment is empty using if
append the comment

craete a button for the about an in the button put the anchor button
let the diffrent anchors led someone to the diffrent links that are in the diffrent headers of the html document
have a paragraph that comes before the items of the API that talk about the diffrent items in the document
under the gallery id start inserting images
under the video id start inserting the video
create a button called back up which returns someone to the top of the page



link the css document to the html
add an image as the background
style the diffrent headers
style the navigation bar
style the paragraphs
style the comment section
style the items fetched from the API
